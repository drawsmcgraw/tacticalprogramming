<p>In trying to keep up with the latest in technology and staying relevant, it's easy to forget that each one of these emerging technologies is built upon a bedrock of simple, reliable tools. Simple tools that you can learn, and then use everywhere you go because they'll never be obsolete.</p>
<p>For my case (and yours, if you're reading this), that means that the fundamentals include (but are certainly not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Vim</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>A proven, yet relevant programming language. Today, for me, that's Python. It may be different for you or for me ten years from now.</li>
<li>Linux troubleshooting toolsets (<code>iostat</code>, <code>htop</code>, <code>dmesg</code>, <code>bash</code>, etc).</li>
<li>Did I mention Bash?</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part of this approach is that, when you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBtCT96OCfg">working with complex tools and doing really cool things</a>, you can <em>always</em> fall back on these fundamental skills when the fancy shiny abstraction layers fail you (and they will fail you, it's their nature).</p>
<p>Double down on the basics. It's one of the few investments in this field with a guaranteed return.</p>                </article>
