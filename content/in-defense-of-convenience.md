Title: In Defense of Convenience

When there's a setback, a technical bump in the road, people who don't really care will dismiss the problem with "it's just an inconvenience". The subtext is "grow up, deal with it". 

But convenience has knock-on effects:
- convenient things get done often, because they're easy to do
- convenient things free up time, because they take less time
- convenient things can be done by anyone, _because they're easy to do_

Making something "convenient" isn't just about making the job cushier. It unlocks more time, it invites more people into the room. It lets us all _do more with our time_ because we're not caught up in the toil of doing one more mundane task.

Yes. I want convenience. Because I have other things I'd rather be doing with my time.
