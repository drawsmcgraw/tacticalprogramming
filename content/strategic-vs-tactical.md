Title: Strategic vs Tactical

Entire books have been written on the topic of Strategic vs Tactical. At the risk of creating more noise, I'd like to add my experience to the collection.

Talking with [Tom Hatch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thhatch) about, well, a lot of things, this topic came up and he had the best illustration. I'm sure you've heard a varient of it before.

If I'm defending my house (let's pretend it's a zombie apocalypse just for fun), the "man at the door" is my Tactical need. I gotta do something about this _right now_. Meanwhile, the "man on the hill", whom I can see but isn't an immediate threat, is my Strategic need. I'm going to need to do something about that. I have time to plan, and I cannot ignore it forever. But I can think differently about that problem. 

Use your zombie apocalypse experience for a compare/contrast on the creative solutions to Strategic vs Tactical.
